Compatipede
=========

Compatipede is a website compatibility check framework/infrastructure

The General idea is to have several webcompat processes running listening to
a RabbitMQ service, from which they are fed with URLs.

A URL is then opened once using the Firefox UserAgent and another time using the
WebKit UserAgent and checked for compatibility:
- Equal redirects
- CSS style compatibility
- Source code compatibility
- Other custom tests

Resuls of each run are written to a MongoDB


How to setup
============
Automating Compatibility

For now this only runs on Linux machines.

The requirments for this service to run are:

- gir1.2-webkit-3.0
- gir1.2-soup-2.4
- xvfb
- gobject-introspection
- python-dbus
- dbus-x11
- rabbitmq-server
- mongodb-server

To install them all, run

    sudo apt-get install gir1.2-webkit-3.0 gir1.2-soup-2.4 xvfb gobject-introspection python-dbus dbus-x11 rabbitmq-server mongodb-server

It is recommended to run it on Ubuntu 13.04 or higher.

In addition, the following Python modules must be available:
- tinycss
- pika
- pymongo

They can all be installed with pip:

    sudo pip install tinycss pika pymongo


How to run it:
==============

    python webcompat.py listen

sets up a process that will handle a queue of URLs, run tests and store data.
To add URLs to the queue, do this in a separate terminal window:

    python webcompat.py push http://example.com
